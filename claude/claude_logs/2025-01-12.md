Why is the ocean salty?


### Response
```json
"Tears of ancient earth,\nMinerals dissolved in time,\nRivers carry salt to sea -\nNature's briny paradigm.\n\nEons pass, waves roll on,\nEach drop holds earth's history,\nWhile creatures swim in crystal depths\nOf this eternal salty sea."
```

#### Agent
Tears of ancient earth,
Minerals dissolved in time,
Rivers carry salt to sea -
Nature's briny paradigm.

Eons pass, waves roll on,
Each drop holds earth's history,
While creatures swim in crystal depths
Of this eternal salty sea.
