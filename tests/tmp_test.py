# Entry point for pytest
#
# This allows debugging of pytest unit tests in Spyder (or command line).
# In Spyder, set your breakpoints as required, then run this script
# (no need to debug, run is enough).
# The debugger will break automatically on the pytest.main().
# Continue the execution to jump to your own breakpoints.

#import pdb
#import pytest
#pdb.set_trace()
#pytest.main()
